But the Vidyadhara could live for a thousand years, much longer than the Foxians. Yu searched for ways to release his lover from the grip of death. He fell for the trickery of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and asked his lover to take the longevity medicine of Abundance without telling her what it was. The Foxian girl turned into an abomination that no longer loved him before being slain by the Cloud Knights. To prevent Yu, who was overwhelmed by grief, from becoming mara-struck, the Alchemy Commission ordered him to take the Longevity Pill of Cruelty that deprived him of love and desire until his demise.\nThe legend has another version, in which Yu was not of the Vidyadhara but a mere mortal, and the Foxian girl was a spy planted by the Disciples to infiltrate the Alchemy Commission. This version is not as popular, for it turns a romance story into a political power struggle.\n\n\"Those who love and live deeply fall into mara, while those who sever desire and passions can live for a millennium. Ask yourself, then, why fear mara, and why take joy in a long life?\""

It is for this reason that the Interdimensional Trees tend to shake off their leaves rather late in the year. To help their leaves land, these trees, in the course of evolution, gave their leaves the ability to conduct fast short-distance warp-jumps towards the ground at frequencies that cannot be observed by naked eyes. Even so, not every leaf gets to land on the ground. Those lucky enough to make it watch others rise into the sky and burn as they are devoured by the atmosphere.\n\n\"Wow.\""

She successfully created Phase Flame, which almost immediately changed to another phase. By the time the Flame returned to the Sserkal Phase, our genius had already passed away. She tried to harness the Flame but had too little time to do so. Thus, the Phase Flame continued to change between phases across different worlds, leaving behind the seeds of flame.\n\n\"Sserkal's life was remarkable.
